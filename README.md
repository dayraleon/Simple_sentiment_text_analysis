# Simple_sentiment_text_analysis

## Description

Simple sentiment text analysis means looking at a piece of writing to figure out if it sounds happy, sad, or neutral. You do this by checking each word to see if it's positive, negative, or just neutral. This helps us understand the overall feeling behind the writing, like if it's joyful, upset, or neither. It's handy for things like checking what people think on social media or understanding what customers say about products.
